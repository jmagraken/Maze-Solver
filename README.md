# Maze-Solver

Prints a solution to a plain text maze to the command line.

Instructions: 

Clone repository and run "MazeSolver.java", adding the .txt file of your choice as a command line argument.

Imagining the maze as a matrix, the first line of the text file must contain the maze's dimensions. The second line gives the row-column position of the start of the maze, and the third line gives the row-column position of the end of the maze. Asterisks denote the walls of the maze.

For example:

5 8
0 1
4 6
* ******
*      *
* ******
*      *
****** *

Repository contains a folder of 10 example mazes for demo purposes.
